How to apply multiply to Hex?

----
Ideas:
----
circle, in which colours are. circle divided into segments.
for example, can have 8 segments, each have a borderline from radian value.
each segments represents Hue.

***Saturation (=Chroma) (0,00 - 1,00):
the closer to origo, the lower the Saturation:
    Origo(low Saturation) == white, Perimeter (high Saturation) = 'full colour'
If Hue is (255, 0, 0) (now at Perimeter), moving closer to origo increases G and B equally towards 255.

***Value (0,00 - 1,00):
Multiplies the (Hue * Saturation): V(0,00) == black, V(1,00) == colour(Hue * Saturation)
